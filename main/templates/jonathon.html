            <p>Just like my two boys,</p>
            <p>I love to explore and learn new things.</p>
            <img src="{% static 'img/boys.jpg' %}" alt="The boys playing together" class="story-pic">
            <p>I also love to create new tools and improve things that I'm working on.</p>
            <p>I love finding new problems to solve and I love to be challenged each day in what I do.</p>
            <p>I attended the Python/Django web development course at <a href="http://codingcamp.us/">Coding Campus</a> to learn full stack web development.</p>

                <p>I come from a military background. With over 15 years in the Utah Army National Guard, I have traveled all over the world and have had the good fortune of enjoying some unique experiences and becoming familiar with a wide range of cultures.</p>
                <p>I have also had the great opportunity to learn how to be self reliant and to apply myself to the tasks at hand.</p>

            <p>But it's not all work and no play at my house, I also love to go out and have fun with the family.</p>
            <p>Being a developer gives me the chance to do something I love, while also being able to spend more time with those most important to me.</p>
